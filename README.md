# QA influx simulator

Directory contents:

* ```mockup-server```` a play server which will serve as a mockup for the backend (See ```mockup-server/README.md``` for details)
* ```build.sbt``` a build defintion which currently does nothing. We will use this file in the future to run tasks from the mockup-server
as well as from the influx simulator itself.
